# Problem: Matrix Diagonal Difference (Double Loop)
# Write a program that calculates the absolute difference between the sums of the diagonals of a square matrix.

matrix = [
    [11, 2, 4],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [10, 8, -12]
]

# Initialize sums for the diagonals
left_diagonal_sum = 0
right_diagonal_sum = 0

# Calculate the sums of the diagonals
# (The coder should write the solution here)

# Calculate the absolute difference
difference = abs(left_diagonal_sum - right_diagonal_sum)
print("Absolute diagonal difference:", difference)
