# Basic Problems and Homework

This repository contains a collection of basic problems and homework assignments. Each homework is named `homework` followed by a number or description.

The problems are solved using Python, but the solutions are close to pseudocode. Language-specific features are not used much, as the intention was to keep the solutions simple and easy to understand.

Feel free to explore the problems and solutions provided in this repository.
